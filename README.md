# Comic Theme CV Template

A minimal interactive CV / portfolio template with a comic-style theme based on Spiderman: Into the Multiverse. It includes a simple HTML entry point and two JavaScript features: a jukebox for audio and a parallax effect for scrolling.

## Files

- `index.html` — main HTML page for the template.
- `jukebox.js` — simple audio jukebox / player logic.
- `parallax.js` — parallax scrolling effects used in the page.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or copy these files into a web project.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser (no build step required).

For local development with live reload, you can run a simple HTTP server (Python example):

```
python -m http.server 8000

# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Notes

- This template is intentionally small and dependency-free.
- Inspect `jukebox.js` and `parallax.js` to adapt behavior or styling.

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to improve the template.
